            <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
            <p>When I was young, one of the countries we'd always visit would be
            Hong Kong. I always enjoyed our trips to Hong Kong as we'd get to spend
            time as a family and eat a lot of great food. Riding the train in Hong
            Kong was also nostalgic since it felt like every time I went there it
            would feel slightly different but still feel familiar as we'd been there
            a couple times already. Food in Hong Kong is really good. Service their
            is also very fast, like people there just operate quicker. Sometimes it
            might feel rude with how they treat you but I think it's really just
            how they do stuff there in Hong Kong. </p>

            <h3>Taiwan</h3>
            <p>Taiwan was also one of the countries I would also visit. Either it
            was with my family or with my friends on a study tour. Food there is
            also great. It feels like I could eat anything there and it would still
            feel like I'm eating good quality food. Although, there was a time when
            I was with my parents and we went to this food stall that had so many
            people lining up just to eat. So we also tried it, and at first I felt
            there was something off with the food but I just ate it either way.
            After a bit, my dad asked what we were eating and my mom said it was
            intestines. Needless to say, my sister, my dad, and I were quite shocked
            that we were eating intestines and even more shocked that there were
            that many people lined up for it. </p>
